## Part 1: Existing conditions analysis
- Location, land use
- Physical conditions
- Traffic controls
- Roadway user behaviors
    
## Part 2: [Crash data analysis](2_Crash-data-analysis.ipynb)
### (1) Crash statistics description
- Time: Year, Month, Day of Week, Hour
- Crash Type, Type x Severity, Type x Time
- Crash Severity, Severity x Time
    
### (2) Contributing factors analysis
- Roadway engineering factors
- Operation factors
- Environment conditions
- Human factors

### (3) Crash reports and collision diagram
- Read crash reports and perform a root cause analysis
- Plot the collision diagram
- Find temporal/spatial patterns

## Part 3: [Traffic operation analysis](3_Vehicle-operation-analysis.ipynb)
- Traffic volume and turning movements
- Speed analysis
- Level-of-Service
- Pedestrian gap analysis 

## Part 4: [Pedestrian and bicyclists activities](4_Pedestrian-and-bicyclists-activities.ipynb)
- Volume of pedestrians and bicyclists

## Part 5: Assessment of supporting documentation
- Maintenance records
- Public feedback

## Part 6: Field observation
- Observation of evasive actions, conflicts
- Observation of road user characteristics

## Part 7: Problem identification and countermeasures selection
- Identify safety concerns
- Short term solutions
- Long term solutions
